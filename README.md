# iepathos-npos uses: Django 1.4.2, South, MySQL and Python scripting.

### Django app 'npos' creates a basic models for non-profit organizations based on the information given by the irs.  Includes: electronic identification number, name, city, state and country.

### nposiepathos.py parses the list of tax exempt non-profit organizations, data-download-pub78.txt and write them into the MySQL database iepathos.  I've commented up this script a lot, it's pretty self-explanatory.
